# Macros and Constants Exercises

This folder contains a set of C++ exercises related to using macros and constants. These exercises were created as part of my personal practice and are intended to help me improve my skills in this area.

Each exercise is contained in its own .cpp file and is accompanied by a brief description of what it aims to achieve. The exercises are designed to be completed in the order listed, as each one builds on the skills and concepts learned in the previous exercise.
