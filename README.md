# C++ Exercises

This repository contains a series of programming exercises in C++ that I have solved. Each folder in the repository corresponds to a particular exercise and contains a C++ source code file with my solution, along with a README.md file that describes the problem.

The exercises are a collection of interesting problems that I have found online or in books and solved in my spare time. They are organized in folders by exercise and cover a variety of topics, from the basics of programming to more advanced problems.

If you are interested in learning from my problem-solving process or just want to see some examples of C++ code, this repository might be useful to you. Feel free to explore the exercises and adapt them to your needs.

If you have any suggestions or comments, please feel free to create an issue or send a pull request.

Enjoy!
